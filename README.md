A simple leave a review format. For customers getting a haircut, seeing a stylist, etc, would be able to leave their name along with a review for a particular stylist for their services.

Each stylist would have an assigned ID and each customer would leave a review that can be associated to the ID of that person. Future functionality would allow a stylist to be able to keep track of clients and book appointments.

The single page setup the user sees will render a box containing their name and the body of the review. Since the page doesnt have a login feature, each review can be edited and updated in the database. Deleting a review is also possible, and reflected in the database backend. Since there is no login feature, each customer to leave a review will have their own ID in the database.
